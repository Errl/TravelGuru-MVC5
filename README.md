# TravelGuru-MVC5
In order to learn Asp.net MVC and Entity Framework, I rebuilt elitetravelguru.com using this architecture pattern. I also experimented using Parallax plugins for banners. 

•	Rebuilt elitetravelguru.com using a Model-View-Controller pattern.

•	Built the new backend of the site using asp.net MVC 5 and entity framework 6.

•	Recreated the database relationships in a different architectural pattern using entity framework 6.

•	Implemented ASP.net identity for administration and customer pages.

•	Created a backend infrustructore for customers to administer their own accounts and view itineraries.

•	Created an administration panel for inputting and accessing information in a user friendly format.

•	Continued to implement separation of concerns.
